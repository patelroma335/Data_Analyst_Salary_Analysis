Data Analyst,"Wellth is a fast-growing digital health startup with offices in Los Angeles and New York City. Our mission is to help people living with chronic conditions make healthier choices every day. Chronic disease is one of the largest challenges facing our nation. This challenge is largely created due to patient non-adherence to medications and care plans. Only about 50% of people with chronic conditions follow their care plan as prescribed. This creates enormous health and economic burdens on individuals, families, and communities that are largely preventable. Our platform deploys evidence-based interventions from behavioral economics through a mobile app to dramatically improve patient adherence, health outcomes, and costs of care. Wellth is at the forefront of designing powerful new tools rooted in behavioral science to deliver value to our customers: healthcare providers and insurers.

Behavioral Economics is at the heart of what we do. If you are a fan of books like Nudge, Freakonomics, and Predictably Irrational and were as excited as us that a Nobel Prize went to a professor of behavioral economics in 2017, then this is the place for you. Help us build and scale a platform that is helping hundreds of patients manage their care plan and improve their health. Visit us at www.wellthapp.com for more information.

We have created a smartphone app that uses the power of financial incentives to improve patient adherence. Our technology also provides valuable information to nurses and other healthcare professionals in the form of weekly adherence report cards and real-time alerts to help provide high-touch care to their patients. Patients check in every day by taking a photo of their medications in their hand.

The Court faces a wide variety of business intelligence (BI) needs: performance assessment, resource deployment, fiscal analysis, and others. In the midst of a significant improvement of its IT infrastructure, LASC is embarking on a campaign to significantly improve its BI capacity to exploit this data-rich environment.

ABOUT THE POSITION
To meet these needs, LASC is in need of senior data analyst with the skills and abilities to handle all stages of the data science task: extract, test and load; data wrangling; dashboard and report creation to help end users solve business problems. In addition, provides support on complex projects that require gathering data, analyzing information, identifying relevant facts, and presenting information and findings in appropriate formats, prepares charts, graphs memoranda, or other ad hoc reports for Court leadership, to convey operational, organizational, statistical, or financial information, and performance.

The ideal candidate loves to learn, as the Court environment is a rich mix of complex and challenging legal and administrative concepts, and as the Court faces a wide range of business challenges.

LASC uses the Microsoft stack and thus a strong candidate will have demonstrated skills with using Power BI, DAX, Visual BASIC, and/or Excel. Knowledge of SQL is plus, as is hands-on experience with statistical packages such as R, Stata, SPSS, SAS, and others.

Data Studio Analyst,"At Priceonomics, our core skill is making data interesting. How do you find a great idea in a dense data set? What’s the best way to present it? How do you create a story where the data is the main character?

As it turns out, there is commercial value in telling a story focused on data. Companies have lots of data, but they have less experience in using it to tell stories that will spread on the Internet.

That’s a shame, because when it comes to content marketing, people seem to actually like it when companies share exciting insights from their data. When you approach a company’s data like a journalist telling a story or an analyst uncovering a trend—rather than a marketer engaging in pure self-promotion—you can produce work that will get your friends talking and gain the attention of publications like The Economist and the New York Times.

In December, we launched The Priceonomics Data Studio, a content marketing agency that helps companies turn their data into stories that spread. Although our data studio is only a few months old, we now work with dozens of companies, including Fortune 100 corporations, “unicorn” tech companies, and small startups. Half our customers are B2B (they sell to businesses) and half are B2C (they sell to consumers).

Working with companies, we’ve told data-driven stories on topics ranging from the driving preferences of Democrats and Republicans to the average size of a bridal party in weddings across the country.

To grow the Priceonomics Data Studio and create more interesting data stories, we need help meeting the demand. Maybe you are interested?

We are looking for people who are comfortable working with data to help us turn data into content for our clients. We’ll send you a raw data file, some thoughts on the topic, and a template for how the charts should look. You’ll create an awesome data-driven article with our help.

For each piece, we’ll pay you (generally around $1000). We’re looking to work closely with people who can work quickly with data, have a knack for visualization, and can complete projects like this in approximately 10 hours or less. If you’re good at this and enjoy it, you can work on nearly as many of these projects with us as you like.

So, are you interested? We need two things from you. First, an honest assessment of if you can do this sort of work. Second, the answer to a very quick “data puzzle.”

1. A quick puzzle

Tell us the median price of booking a room in each of the top 100 cities in this data set.

You can download the data here and read the “backstory” here. This is a fictional data set, but it’s very typical of the kind of raw information we analyze for a Priceonomics Blog post or a project in our Data Studio.

More specifically, send us back a table with a list of the median price in each city, ranked from most to least expensive. Restrict your analysis to just to the ""top 100"" cities that have the most units on the market.

You can also briefly describe how you solved it, any assumptions you made, or even send us the work. If some parts of the results look odd, you can propose how you’d improve the analysis given the data available in the file.

This puzzle should be a relatively quick task—not something that requires lots of brute force. If you need a hint on how to do this, here’s one.

2. An honest assessment

Companies give us data, and we turn it into interesting stories. Here are some examples of how we used data about driving preferences, bridal parties, and consumer spending habits at the grocery story. Can you do this sort of work?

It requires making maps and tables—and telling a story. It also requires fluency in Excel or a difference analysis program like R. If you know how to use Excel, can you perform: a pivot table, a vlookup, an index-match, an array, and the mid function?

Maybe you’re a PhD student, a data journalist at a blog, or a recovering management consultant who wants to work with interesting data and make some extra money.

Whatever your situation, tell us about your background and why you can do this sort of work.

To apply to become part of this program, just send an email to jobs@priceonomics.com with the answers to these questions. Feel free to let us know anything else we should know about you in the email.

We love a good story about data, and we look forward to creating some with you.

We’re also hiring a full time Writer/Analyst to join us in San Francisco. You’ll work at crunching data and telling stories for our customers and on the Priceonomics Blog. If you’re interested in a full time job, complete the puzzle and then send us a message at jobs@priceonomics.com.

Senior Business Data Analyst,"About Hazelcast

Hazelcast provides an in-memory computing platform that empowers Global 2000 enterprises to deliver innovative, low-latency, data-centric applications. Built for ultra-fast processing at an extreme scale, the platform can be deployed on-premise or consumed as a Cloud Service. Our cloud-native in-memory data grid and event stream processing technologies are trusted by leading companies such as J.P. Morgan Chase, Charter Communications, Ellie Mae, UBS, and National Australia Bank to accelerate business-critical applications.

We're far from the typical Silicon Valley start-up story. Even though we're headquartered in San Mateo, CA, our origins trace back to Turkey, where a majority of our engineering team resides. Nowadays, we've become a highly distributed global family of 120+ employees. We are supported by a global cast of VC's across the U.S., U.K., and Europe.

Background to the Role

Hazelcast has an established global finance and sales operations function with experienced leadership based in San Mateo, CA, and support staff and professional advisors based in Turkey and the U.K. to provide local data processing and jurisdiction expertise outside of the U.S.

We are seeking a U.S.-based Sr. Business Data Analyst to complement the existing FP&A skills within the Finance & Sales Ops Function. The position will report to the COO/CFO based in San Mateo. This is a replacement hire to both fit into the existing role and responsibilities, as well as to be part of a broader team whose responsibilities are increasing as the Company is anticipating continued growth.

Overview of the Finance & Sales Ops Function

The Finance & Sales Ops function supports an international business of both direct and channel selling, with employees and channel partners spread across many countries. In addition to internationally located support staff and professional service providers, Hazelcast has deployed a range of Cloud app solutions to ensure the production of accurate and timely sales, operation, and accounting/management information.

The COVID-19 related work-from-home requirements have not impeded the teams' operation. In fact, the past investment in Cloud apps and the Company's distributed work culture is firmly supporting this 'new normal' operational mode. Both the day to day operations, and weekly/monthly reporting cycles of the business, are therefore operating smoothly. We are looking for someone to pick up the ball and help the organization move to the next level of business analysis and insight.

Location is, therefore, not an issue as all responsibilities can be performed remotely, and there will be no firm requirement to visit an office. However, when Shelter-In-Place regulations are lifted, and if office visits are viewed as desirable, the HQ office location is in San Mateo, CA.

What We're Seeking

We are seeking a strong Sr. Business Data Analyst to help us better understand our metrics through rigorous business analysis and insights. Hazelcast's business is both growing in scale as well as expanding its horizons through, for example, new strategic channel partner relationships, products, and services. This role provides a unique opportunity and timing to join a company to analyze new business-critical challenges and opportunities and present data-driven recommendations and insights to the management team. Not only will this role provide exposure to multiple business functions, such as Product Marketing, Cloud Operations, Sales Operations, Marketing, and Financial Planning, but also top executives, including the CEO.

Previous experience(s) in an early-stage software company environment will be important for the candidate, as not everything has yet been built. Data is often messy or incomplete. This role is just as much about doing the difficult work to design the core processes, as it is in getting reliable analytics results. It, therefore, is an opportunity to shape and drive a meaningful impact on the business by helping develop how we approach analytics at the Company.

Are you the type of person who feels they could solve any problem if they just had the right data? Are you someone who can spot the hidden trends in metrics and come up with compelling arguments to explain them? Then this role is for you, responsible for delivering both regular and ad-hoc analysis with actionable insights and translating stakeholders' priorities into dashboards.

Your Impact & Expected Outcomes:
Independently find and deliver analytics insights and forecasts in areas of business operations to drive high stakes business decisions
Develop an understanding for KPIs and analysis of our end-to-end funnel
Own analytics and be the go-to person for data-driven decision making
Facilitate cross-functional partnering in solving business problems and develop strong relationships with the stakeholders
Develop insight and knowledge of trends and factors influencing the business
Present synthesized data-driven analysis and insights to the senior members/ executives
Responsibilities Include:
Understand existing business and financial metrics and seek efficiencies in data gathering techniques and visualization of reporting
Analyze data, and partner with internal team members, to identify opportunities for improvement of metric relevance or expansion of metric breadth
Find improvements in the linkage of performance indicators to evaluate business performance and achievement of team Key Results (from OKRs)
Work with the Finance & Sales Ops team to collaboratively assist in periodic production of budget and forecast financial models
Perform exploratory data analysis to identify trends, patterns, correlations, and insights and provide business recommendations to the leadership team in a simple, clear, and compelling manner
Identify data quality and process improvement opportunities; in particular, finding opportunities to leverage data contained within multiple Systems while ensuring data integrity and consistency across their technological platforms
Identify opportunities for automated monitoring and work with Sales Ops team and ensuring that automated reports and metrics are accurate and delivered in a timely manner
Collaborate with key stakeholders such as Sales, Marketing, Sales Operations, Product/Engineers to build self-service reports and establish automated processes for large scale data analyses as well as ad-hoc reporting
Build, manage, and automate key business metrics into dashboards and scorecards that tell a story
Develop analytics to enable marketing-sales funnel and campaign ROI
Establish benchmarks for growth & expansion across multiple marketing channels, including paid search/social, email marketing, events, web, etc.
Required Skills and Experience:
Bachelor's degree in either Math, Accounting, Finance, Statistics, Business, or a related field. MBA or Masters in Analytics would be a plus
4+ years of experience in an analytics, sales ops, or finance, in a software company
Self-starter, fast learner with a problem-solving attitude, and strong collaborator: there is no job too big or too small if it contributes to the Mission and makes our business better
Ability to distill complex data into easy to understand analysis with actionable conclusions and recommendations
Strong data mining skills, extended Excel skills, experience with data visualization tools, and use of PPT and GSuite apps. Experience of Adaptive Insights a plus
Experience in gathering requirements and formulating business metrics for reporting
Understanding of data modeling concepts
Extremely detail-oriented and organized; highly quantitative and creative, passionate about using data to guide strategy
Ability to communicate data, at a level appropriate for the audience
Thrive in a fast-paced start-up environment!
The ideal candidate will bring a strong business mindset for approaching problems in a quantitative way and will have the technical skills for data extraction and manipulation. This is the perfect opportunity for someone with 4+ years of experience to gain rapid professional and personal development, gain executive exposure, and drive decisions at a high-growth company. High-level prioritization of effort and time will be guided by the COO/CFO. Still, within that, the individual will be expected to be a self-starter and manage their time accordingly.
